# Wall art: new gallery video

## Change
`gallery_video_url` in `templates/product.pg-wallart.json` now points at the
video uploaded to Files on 20 Aug (`hf_20260820_024658_...mp4`, 1440x1570,
4.3s), replacing `heroic-wall-art-loop.mp4`. Same HD-1080p rendition tier as
before.

## Looping
No change needed. `sections/pg-landing.liquid` renders the tag as
`<video ... autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata">`, so `loop` is
already on it and applies to whatever URL the setting holds.

## Note
The old clip was 1440x1920 (3:4); the new one is 1440x1570 (~11:12), so the
video block is shorter on desktop, where it renders at its natural aspect.
Under 900px it is unaffected, being forced to 1:1 with object-fit:cover.
