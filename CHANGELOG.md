# Cart add-ons: retarget the "flip" family to the R36S Ultra

## Problem
The Pocket Era Flip SP was rewritten in place into the **Pocket Era R36S
Ultra** (same product record, so its 110 Judge.me reviews carry over). That
moved five product handles and renamed the Bundle option values, which
`sections/pg-cart-addons.liquid` hardcodes. Left alone, the whole Flip/Ultra
family would silently drop out of the cart upsell: no case rows, no screen
protector row, no Protection Kit beside a Max bundle.

## Cause
Three things in that file were pinned to the old listing:

- **The handle table `H`** named `pocket-era-flip-sp` and the three
  `flip-sp-*` accessory handles plus `flip-sp-max-kit`. Shopify 301s the
  storefront URLs, but the file matches `cart.items[].handle` and fetches
  `/products/<handle>.js`, so stale handles just stop matching.
- **`FB`** held the Flip SP's bundle labels (`Single Device`, `Max Package`).
  The Ultra uses the R36 Pro 2's labels (`Single Device (64GB)`,
  `Max Bundle (128GB)`) so both consoles read the same.
- **Option order.** The Flip SP was `o1 = Color, o2 = Bundle`. The Ultra
  matches the Pro 2 at `o1 = Bundle, o2 = Color`, so the `flip` family's
  `single` / `max` / `colour` accessors were reading the wrong option.

## Fix
`sections/pg-cart-addons.liquid`, four edits, no behaviour change beyond the
retarget:

- `H.flip`, `H.fsil`, `H.fhard`, `H.fprot`, `H.fkit` point at the
  `pocket-era-r36s-ultra` / `r36s-ultra-*` handles.
- `FB` now carries the `(64GB)` / `(128GB)` labels.
- The `flip` family reads `v.o1` for the bundle and `v.o2` for the colour.
- The block comment above `FAMS` describes the Ultra's option order.

The `flip` / `fsil` / `fhard` / `fprot` / `fkit` **keys keep their short
names** so the rest of the file (`FLIPS`, `flipOffer`, `flipUpgrade`, the
`fduo` / `fswitch` key tests) is untouched. All six variant IDs
(`FSIL_VARIANT`, `FHARD_VARIANT`, `FPROT_VARIANT`, `FKIT_VARIANT` and the
Pro 2 pair) are unchanged — only SKUs moved on those products, so every
add-to-cart call still resolves.

Not yet pushed to the live theme — the Ultra is in DRAFT pending photos, so
nothing is broken for customers until it goes live.

# Cart drawer: stop discount/progress flicker (safe override)

## Problem
In the cart drawer, the free-shipping / discount progress bar and status
messages visibly flickered and briefly showed the wrong discount before
settling, especially as line items or quantities changed.

## Cause
Two things compound in `nc-cro` (the large, checkout-adjacent CRO file):
- A redundant, **un-debounced** `MutationObserver(drawerExtras)` runs on every
  cart mutation, on top of the well-behaved debounced `cartObs` observer that
  already calls `drawerExtras` (disconnect/reconnect guarded). The two race and
  re-render the drawer extras repeatedly.
- The progress-bar fill and status text swap their values instantly, so each
  recompute reads as a hard "snap"/flash rather than a smooth change.

## Fix
Added a self-contained override block to `sections/nc-nohover.liquid`, which
loads after `nc-cro` so it wins cleanly. **No checkout or add-to-cart logic is
touched** — the fix is a guard flag plus CSS:

- **Pre-stamps `#cart[data-nc-extras]`** at parse time (with a short-lived
  `documentElement` observer fallback) so `nc-cro` skips creating its redundant
  observer. `drawerExtras` still runs via the debounced `cartObs`, so nothing is
  lost; if the stamp loses the race it is a harmless no-op.
- **Adds width/color/opacity transitions** to `.nc-track-fill` and the
  ship/discount/tier/gift status elements so value changes ease instead of
  snapping.

Because `nc-cro` is a live-theme file (177KB, not tracked in this repo) and the
storefront isn't previewable from here, the fix was scoped to the override layer
to eliminate any risk to the cart/checkout path. A deeper consolidation of the
competing observers should be done with live preview (Shopify CLI).

# Site fix: product gallery arrow centering

## Problem
On the product page, the image carousel prev/next arrows (the round white
`‹` / `›` buttons) were not vertically centered on the product image. They sat
above the middle of the image.

## Cause
The Xtra theme's `screen.css` hardcodes the gallery arrow container height:

    .l4pr .swiper-button-nav { bottom: auto; width: 67px; height: 540px; }

The visible round button (`:after`) centers itself at `top: 50%` of that
container. Because the height is pinned to 540px rather than the real image
height, on tall/square product images (aspect-ratio 1/1) the arrows center on
540px and end up above the true middle.

## Fix
A small dedicated section (`sections/nc-gallery-fix.liquid`) lets the arrow
container span the actual gallery height, so `top: 50%` resolves to the real
center:

    @media only screen and (min-width:761px){
      #content .l4pr.aside-pager .swiper-button-nav{
        top:0!important; bottom:0!important; height:auto!important
      }
    }

Desktop/tablet only (min-width:761px). Mobile (<=760px) uses a separate
below-image arrow layout and is untouched.

The section is registered in `templates/product.json`, so it applies to every
product that uses the default product template.

# Site fix: collection hero carousel — sync banner image, dots, and text

## Problem
On the collection hero (`nc-collection-hero`, e.g. Best Sellers), the rotating
banner image, the caption text, and the dots advanced on different clocks, so
they were visibly out of sync.

## Cause
Two independent timers:
- Banner image rotated every 4500ms (own `setInterval` in `nc-foot-fix.liquid`).
- Caption text rotated every 3500ms (`setInterval` in `nc-collection-hero.liquid`);
  the dots followed the caption via a MutationObserver.

4500ms vs 3500ms meant the image drifted against the text and dots.

## Fix (`sections/nc-foot-fix.liquid`)
Removed the banner image's independent 4500ms interval and instead advanced the
image layer inside the same observer that already syncs the dots to the caption.
Now the caption's single 3500ms timer is the one master clock: on each tick the
caption, the dots, and the banner image all change together.

Summer Sale is untouched: its banner uses `.nc-ed__img--full` and has no rotating
image layers (`:not(.nc-ed__img--full)`), so the sync code no-ops there.

# Site fix: free-gift bar restyle to match the brand

## Problem
The "Free 5-Level Resistance Band Set / GIFT WITH ANY PURCHASE / INCLUDED FREE"
bar (`.nc-gift-home`, injected by `nc-cro.liquid`) used a mint-green gradient
(#F6FAF6 -> #B7D6C4) with a tan pill, clashing with the site's cream/sand + teal
brand palette.

## Fix (`sections/nc-nohover.liquid`, loads last globally)
Appended a scoped override:
- Bar background -> brand cream/sand gradient (#F7F1E3 -> #E6D6B4) with a subtle
  teal border and soft shadow, so it reads as an on-brand raised card.
- Eyebrow -> brand teal (#2C6E72); heading charcoal (#0F2A33); sub muted (#3C5860).
- "INCLUDED FREE" pill -> brand teal gradient (#2C6E72 -> #15414A) with white text
  (keeps the existing subtle shimmer animation).

Scoped with `#content .nc-gift-home` for specificity; nc-nohover loads after
nc-cro so it wins cleanly. No change to layout or responsive sizing.

# Homepage: free-gift promo in the hero + header

The gift promo is injected at runtime (not in theme files) and only appeared on
collection pages, so instead of moving that element, added two self-contained,
on-brand free-gift elements (in `sections/nc-nohover.liquid`, global, homepage-scoped
by selector):

- **Hero card** (`.nc-herogift`): a compact cream/teal card injected into the hero
  left column (`.nch-hero-text`), filling the empty space under the trust row.
  "Free 5-pack resistance bands / Added free to every order. No code needed." + FREE pill,
  links to /collections/best-sellers.
- **Header pill** (`.nc-hdr-gift`): a small teal pill in the empty space left of the
  logo (desktop only, min-width 1001px), "🎁 Free 5-pack resistance bands",
  links to /collections/best-sellers. Hidden on mobile.

Both are created via JS with retries + a MutationObserver so they appear reliably.
